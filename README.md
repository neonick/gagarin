Gagarin is frontend template* based on PostCSS (with some magic plugins), Jade and Gulp. I use [Lost Grid System](https://github.com/corysimmons/lost) for easy handling with grids.

**Poyekhali!**

#### * Oh, yes, I wrote my own frontend framework

This development has two objectives – to develop my own template for a quick start of new project.
The second goal – practice with Github and with ancillary services and technologies.
I want to understand the most advanced frontend technology, because it seems to me that I was lagging behind many developers.
