Gagarin is frontend template[*](#footnote) based on [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss), Jade and Gulp. 
I use [Lost Grid System](https://github.com/corysimmons/lost) for easy handling with grids and several others vendor plugins.

###### Footnote

<img width="150" height="150" align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neonick/gagarin/master/src/i/frontend_technologies.gif" title="Modern frontend developer">

Oh, yes, I wrote my own frontend framework.

This development has two objectives – to develop my own template for a quick start of new project.
The second goal – practice with Github and with ancillary services and technologies.
I want to understand the most advanced frontend technology, because it seems to me that I was lagging behind many developers.
