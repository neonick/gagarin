Gagarin is frontend template[*](#footnote) based on [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss), Jade and Gulp. 
I use [Lost Grid System](https://github.com/corysimmons/lost) for easy handling with grids and several others vendor plugins.

**Poyekhali!**

###### Footnote

Oh, yes, I wrote my own frontend framework.

This development has two objectives – to develop my own template for a quick start of new project.
The second goal – practice with Github and with ancillary services and technologies.
I want to understand the most advanced frontend technology, because it seems to me that I was little lagging behind.
